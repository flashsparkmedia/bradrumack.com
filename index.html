                    "DMD (<a href='https://www.dmdsystems.com/en-us/home' target='_blank'>DMD Systems</a>) provides ITAD
                    solutions adhering to the most rigorous environmental and security standards to deliver confidence
                    for
                    companies who value our world and their reputation. DMD works with hundreds of companies and public
                    entities to securely
                    destroy their data, decommission assets, and redeploy or remarket the equipment across IT categories
                    including Data Center,
                    End User Compute, and Mobility."
                </p>
                <p>
                    DMD had recently launched a new product, but soon realized that their shipping processes currently
                    in place didn't scale to
                    fit this new product's needs. They came to me seeking a way to integrate round-trip shipping into
                    ShipStation's API, and then allow
                    end-users the ability to track their shipment both to them and then back to DMD. DMD's clients can
                    also generate company-wide
                    containing all users' shipments. Data from their sales system is imported into the application via
                    CSV, then shipping labels for both directions
                    are automatically generated and and provided via PDF for easy printing.

                    H<a href='https://www.hawkinspng.com'>awkins.png</a> is a photography editing business based in Los
                    Angeles, California.
                    Shawn came to me with a need for a way to streamline his process of onboarding new clients and
                    providing
                    editing services. At the time, everything was handled manually - catalogs were uploaded to Shawn's
                    drive account, and
                    project management was just simply email correspondence between Shawn and his clients and editors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Shawn, I created a project management and file-sharing application. Clients are taken through
                    the project creation process where they
                    pick package options and then upload their catalog as a zip file. Projects are then assigned to an
                    editor and follow a lifecycle from editing
                    to review to approval and delivery. Email notifications are automatically sent to applicable parties
                    at certain lifecycle waypoints. A newer
                    feature has new project notifications being sent to Slack, where editors can claim unassigned
                    projects through interaction with a bot.
                    This application was built on MERN stack with the following APIs: Google Drive, Google Workspace
                    email via <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer'>nodemailer</a>,
                    and Slack.

                    "There isn’t enough praise that I can throw Brad’s way throughout the entirety of the development
                    process. Simply put, working with FlashSpark Media has been an indelible process from the ground up.
                    Brad helped me seamlessly build my project into a fully functional and efficiently running website,
                    which was no small task with the asks and requirements needed to get exactly what I was looking for
                    out of Hawkins.png. Communication was consistent, Brad was accessible and a true ease to work with.
                    And I’m now left with a site beyond my expectations that has left myself and my entire clientele in
                    awe and at ease. No need to search any further for all of your web development needs, no matter how
                    in depth. Brad is the man!”
